# STUDENT-INFORMATION-SYSTEM-
In current system there is a step-by-step process from circulation of form(s) to students and receiving that form(s) is consumes more time and we cannot verify identity. Proposed system helps multiple students in entering their detail at the same time and we are able to authorize the user. which is interoperable so it is operable from different platforms too. Proposed System uses MOBILE APPLICATION development.
